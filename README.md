# PRACTICAL ML
### Get started with practical ML

1. **ML hello world** (Keras) (Numpy)
2. **House price prediction** (Keras on top of Tensorflow) (Numpy)
3. **Fashion MNIST-1** (Multi class classifier) (IMAGES) (Tensorflow)
4. **Fashion MNIST-2** (CallBacks)
5. **MNIST** (CNN) (Visualizing CONV and pool layers)
6. **Cat vs Dog-1** (Binary class classfication) (ImageDataGenerator) (Understand Overfitting) (Working on your own data)
7. **Cat vs Dog-2** (Data augmentation) (ImageDataGenerator) (Overfitting-Solution)
8. **Cat vs Dog-visualization** (tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image)
9. **Play with this**
10 **Horses vs Humans-Transfer learning** (Transfer learning) (Inception-V3)


<br />
<br />

**Building a model is a multi-stage process: -**

    Collect, clean and process data
    Prototype and iterate on your model architecture
    Train and evaluate results
    Prepare your model for production

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## TO DO <br/>
- Transfer learning (ResNets or inception_v3) <br/>
- Finding optimal learning rate (Using Callbacks) <br/>
- Add cool real world projects (Pneumonia_detection, handwritten-mathematical-symbols, Face recognition, and much more) <br/>
- Train model in browser (Javascript) <br/>
- Convert and Deploy model (Website/browser (JS) and Android/IOS (Java) or Edge devices (Raspberry Pi)) (Static and dynamic) (using images and live camera feed) (Transfer learning) <br/>
- Lambda layer <br/>

- Working with Audio (NLP) <br/>

- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction <br />

- Sequential models and Functional models
